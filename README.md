# 📊 Code-Forces Profile Analyzer
*A Data Science Project for Competitive Programming Performance Analysis*

---

## 🚀 Project Idea
This project analyzes real-time performance data of Codeforces users using public APIs. It evaluates:

- Current and past contest ratings  
- Problem-solving behaviour  
- Topic-wise strengths (tags)  
- Contest participation trends  
- Comparative analysis between two users  

The goal is to provide clear insights, visualizations, and recommendations based on a user’s competitive programming journey.

---

## 🧩 Workframe / Approach

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Fetch API data (rating, submissions, problems)
- Convert JSON → Python objects
- Remove duplicate submissions
- Filter accepted (“OK”) problems
- Clean missing values and normalize features

### **2. Feature Selection**
- Identify impactful attributes: rating history, tags solved, contest counts.

### **3. Modeling**
- **Random Forest** → Feature importance  
- **Neural Networks** → Predict rating/marks (extendable scope)

### **4. Visualization**
- Rating trend line charts  
- Tag-wise frequency bar charts  
- Predicted vs. actual (scatter plot)  
- Comparison graphs for two users

# 📝 Abstract
Competitive programming platforms like **Codeforces** hold valuable data on user performance.  
The *Code-Forces Profile Analyzer* extracts this data using public APIs and performs:

- Rating analysis  
- Tag-based topic analysis  
- Contest performance monitoring  
- Comparative user insights  

It also visualizes all results using graphs and charts for enhanced interpretation.

# ❗ Problem Statement
Design and implement a data-science–based system that:

- Fetches Codeforces user profile data  
- Analyzes contest performance & behaviour  
- Categorizes solved problems using tags  
- Compares two users visually  
- Presents insights using interactive dashboards

# ⚙️ Procedure of Execution

### **I. Data Preparation**
- Encode categorical variables  
- Scale numerical features  
- Train–test split  

### **II. Model Training**
- Random Forest → Feature importance  
- Neural Network → Prediction model  

### **III. Graph Generation**
- Bar chart → Feature importance  
- Line graph → Accuracy vs loss  
- Scatter plot → Actual vs predicted  
- Comparison charts for two users  

### **IV. Interpretation**
Each graph is explained in terms of:
- Why it is used  
- How it is created  
- What insights it provides
